        "## FILES, EXCEPTIONAL HANDLING, LOGGING AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Difference between interpreted and compiled languages:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Compiled languages (e.g., C, C++) are converted directly into machine code by a compiler before execution. They tend to be faster but require compilation for each platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) are executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime. They're more portable but generally slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Exception handling in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks to prevent program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Purpose of the finally block:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: The finally block always executes after try and except blocks, regardless of whether an exception occurred. It's typically used for cleanup operations like closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Logging in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS:Logging is the process of recording events and messages during program execution for debugging, monitoring, and auditing purposes using the logging module.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Significance of the del method:\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed. It can be used for cleanup operations, but its use is generally discouraged.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Difference between import and from ... import:\n",
        "\n",
        "import module imports the entire module, requiring module.function() syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "from module import function imports specific functions, allowing direct function() calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Handling multiple exceptions in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Multiple exceptions can be handled by:\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    # code\n",
        "except (ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2) as e:\n",
        "    # handle multiple exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Purpose of the with statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS:The with statement ensures proper resource management (like file closing) by using context managers, even if exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Multithreading uses multiple threads within a single process (shared memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing uses separate processes with independent memory spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Advantages of using logging:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Better debugging capabilities\n",

        "\n",
        "Configurable message severity levels\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexible output destinations\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Memory management in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS:Python's memory management handles allocation and deallocation automatically using a private heap and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Basic steps in exception handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: 1.Enclose code in try block\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Catch exceptions with except blocks\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Optionally use else for code that runs when no exception occurs\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Automates memory allocation/deallocation\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Role of try and except:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: try contains code that might raise exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "except catches and handles specific exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Python's garbage collection system:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Python uses reference counting (immediate cleanup) and a generational garbage collector (cyclic reference detection) for automatic memory management.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Purpose of the else block in exception handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: The else block executes only if no exceptions were raised in the try block, separating normal flow from exception handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Common logging levels in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic info\n",

        "\n",
        "20. Difference between file.read() and file.readline():\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: read() reads the entire file content as a string\n",
        "\n",
        "readline() reads a single line at a time\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Logging module purpose:\n",
        "\n",
